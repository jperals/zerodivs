      applying styles (CSS) on a single HTML element.

      <p>Experimentation and fun.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Long answer:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a web developer I like to learn ways to avoid unnecessary markup (and
        scripts). Often CSS knowledge helps create elegant and robust solutions
        and is an often underrated resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not mean that one should avoid markup and force CSS-based
        solutions at all costs, the point is just to explore what a medium can
        do.
      </p>
      <p>Some resources about the topic that I found interesting include:</p>

    <dt>How did you do it?</dt>
    <dd>
      You can find the code
      <a href="https://github.com/jperals/zerodivs">here</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Is my work being saved?</dt>
    <dd>
      Only to your browser via
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"
        >localStorage</a
      >. In order to share your illustrations, you can export them to
      <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.

    <dt>Why the name "Zero Divs"?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        This might not be super relevant, but I noticed that it's not even
        necessary to have a "div" or similar HTML node, since the styles can be
        applied directly to the body of a page. So it is possible to display
        complex visuals on a page that, from the content perspective, is
        completely empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you make use of the "Export to CodePen" button, you'll see that the
        generated pen has no markup at all (nor JavaScript, of course) --only
        CSS.
      </p>
      <p>And because I just couldn't come up with a better name, that's it.</p>
